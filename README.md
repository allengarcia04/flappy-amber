# Flappy Bird Game

This Flappy Bird game project I created for, Amber, as a special gift for her birthday. I wanted her to have a fun, interactive game to play, and this project was the perfect way to make that happen!

## Project Overview

This game is built using **HTML5**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game utilizes the **HTML5 Canvas** to create the interactive gameplay.

### Features:

- Game loop with smooth animation
- Press space bar to start the game
- Flappy Bird character that jumps when clicked
- Randomly generated pipes that move across the screen
- Collision detection between the bird and pipes
- Score tracking

I hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed building it!
